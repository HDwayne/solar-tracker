SolTrack is a simple, free, fast and accurate C routine to compute the position 
of the Sun. In addition, SolTrack computes rise and set times and azimuths, and 
transit times and altitudes. The code can be used to track the Sun on low-spec 
machine, such as a microcontroller or PLC, and can be used for e.g. (highly) 
concentrated (photovoltaic) solar power. 
SolTrack has been developed by Marc van der Sluys, Paul van Kan and Jurgen 
Reintjes, of the Lectorate of Sustainable Energy at the HAN University of applied 
sciences in Arnhem, the Netherlands. The code is derived from the astronomical 
Fortran library libTheSky and is available under the terms of the GNU LGPL v.3.
