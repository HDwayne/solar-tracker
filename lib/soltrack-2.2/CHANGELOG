  CHANGELOG for SolTrack releases
  http://soltrack.sourceforge.net/


  2.2  2017-09-09  (code rev.13, hash 9f77eee)
	* BUGFIX in SolTrack_RiseSet:
		* final results were converted, then overwritten by local results

	* Changes:
		* SolTrack: convert intermediate results to degrees if desired (longitude, right ascension, etc.)
		* examples: use useDegrees = 1 in TestSolTrackSingle
		* examples: allow local compilation in Makefile


  2.1  2017-04-17  (code rev.11, hash bc23eb8)
	* Add rise, transit and set times
		* function SolTrack_RiseSet in SolTrack_RiseSet.c
		* computes rise, transit and set times to better than a second
		* computes rise and set azimuths and transit altitude to 0.001 degree or better

	* Changes:
		* the struct location is no longer passed as a pointer
			* it shouldn't be updated

	* Add CMake files for automatic compilation (and a simple Makefile for manual compulation)
		* compile and install libraries, header files, man pages and examples


  2.0  2017-02-22  (code rev.6, hash d7838c3)
	* Changed licence from GNU GPL to LGPL for easier use in commercial applications

	* Tuned the code for better speed and accuracy performance:
		* precompute and distribute multiply used variables
		* use own atan2() function (STatan2()) for better speed
		* leave out higher-order terms if it results in a speed gain and negligible accuracy loss
		* optimise constants for best accuracy in the next 100 years
			* code has become faster and more accurate
	* New options:
		* allow use of degrees for input/output angular variables, rather than radians
		* allow definition azimuth=0 for north rather than south
		* allow computation of the distance to the Sun


  1.1  2015-04-11  (code rev.4, hash 7281ce6)
	* Added a second test:
		* TestSolTrackFile.c tests using the 100 dates as before
		* TestSolTrackSingle.c: uses a single hard-coded date to compute the position for


  1.0  2014-11-10  (code rev.1, git hash 1163ff1)
	* First stable version of SolTrack
		* see http://soltrack.sf.net for details
