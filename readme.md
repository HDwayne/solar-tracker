# Solar tracker with ESP32 and soltrack-2.2 library

An embedded system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller to accurately track the position of the sun and adjust the angle of a solar panel accordingly. By constantly monitoring the sun's movement throughout the day, the Solar Tracker ensures that the solar panel is always in the optimal position for maximum energy production. The system uses precise calculations to determine the sun's position and employs relays to adjust panel angles for optimal performance.

## Explanation

the all project is explained in my portfolio website [here](https://https://dwayneherzberg.com/solar-tracker)

## Warning

this project is not complete and is still in development. the code is not yet fully functional and is not yet ready for use. All fonctinnalities are not yet implemented.
